                        <p className="section-text-info">
                            I am a front-end developer with a passion for creating
                            engaging and interactive web experiences.
                            Throughout my learning journey I have gained a
                            solid foundation in web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.
                            I have worked on several personal projects to expand
                            my skill set, including building responsive web pages,
                            creating dynamic user interfaces and complex web applications
                            using React.
                            In addition to my technical skills, I have problem-solving abilities and I
                            enjoy working on design. I am experienced with working with design tools such as Figma and Photoshop to create visually appealing and user-friendly web applications.
                            I am excited to begin my career in front-end development and to continue learning
                            and growing as a developer.
